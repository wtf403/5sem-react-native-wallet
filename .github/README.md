## 🚀 Who Are We

We’re forging a community-driven blockchain platform designed to transform any of yours ideas into reality. We bring together innovators, creators, and believers in a decentralized ecosystem where creativity thrives and ideas spark meaningful action.

**We harness cutting-edge technology**, combining modern frameworks and languages to create a robust and scalable platform. Our tech stack is carefully chosen to deliver performance, security, and an exceptional user experience. Let's dive into *repo* the details.

## 🗂️ What's Inside

Our monorepo is your backstage pass to the Desert App ecosystem. It contains four key components, each playing a vital role in delivering a seamless blockchain experience:

- **[Client](./client/README.md)** – A React Native app that puts the entire Desert experience right at your fingertips.
- **[Gateway](./gateway/README.md)** – A Fastify backend-for-frontend that ensures swift, secure connections to our services.
- **[Core](./core/README.md)** – Robust, scalable Go-based backend services supporting growth and innovation.
- **[Platform](./platform/README.md)** – A custom Cosmos SDK blockchain that powers the entire ecosystem from behind the scenes.

Every component is tuned for performance and scalability, but there’s one vital ingredient that makes it all come alive. It’s driven by the people.
